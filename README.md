# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION & PARADIGMS
LEXICAL AND SYNTAX ANAYLSIS

This is the instruction how to run the coding.

## Lexical Analysis

## Syntax Analysis
It verifies whether or not the input is in the proper syntax (of the language in which it was written) by analyzing its syntactical structure. 
It accomplishes this by constructing a data structure known as a syntax tree or parse tree.

The program will ask for input:

````
Enter the input text:
````

## Valid Input
Here are the valid input for the expression
- Numbers
- Variables such as **x or y**
- Operator such as **+ - * /**
- Comparison such as **< > =**

## Test & Validation

The instruction same as Syntax Analysis. 
It examines the input string for arithmetic expressions containing numbers, identifiers, operators, and brackets. 
The main purpose of this code is to ensure that the compiler handles correct code and to provide an error message for incorrect code.
